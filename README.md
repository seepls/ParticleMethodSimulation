# PROJECT
 "Simulation of **Fluid Mixing** in 3D Stirring tank using Semi helical and Double helical ribbons designs using **Moving Particle Semi-Implicit Method** developed by Seiichi Koshizuka, Kazuya Shibata, and Takuya Matsunaga" 
 
# UTokyo
I had the chance to work directly under **Sensei Takuya Matsunaga** and supervised by **Sensei Seiichi Koshizuka** both are just **AWESOME ! <3 **

### Particle Method simulation
3D simulations for solids use vector graphics implemented with the help of OpenGL or **Mesh modelling structure**
In computer graphics a **polygon mesh** is the collection of vertices, edges, and faces that make up a 3D object 
But the does not work for fluids as the relative distance between particles keep changing, which leads to **high distortion of the polygons** 

Hence we replace the whole 3D object as **collection of particles**. Whose motion is governed with the **Moving Particle Semi-Implicit Method**
The project further deals with calculating a roughly accurate value of **interface area** between 2 fluids while mixing it with variating **blade designs, impellor speed and particle size !**


Demo :

3. Double Helical Ribbon

With further analysis proved that Double helical blade was the best !
